This plugin shows a dialog to select the filament when a print on a Prusa printer with MMU2 is startet in single mode.

The dialog is shown, when the plugin detects a 'Tx' command in the gcode.

So you don't have to go to your printer and select the filament to be used. It can now be done from within Octoprint.

A timeout can be set in the settings (default 30 seconds), after which the dialog is closed. When this happens you have to select the filament on the printer as usual.
